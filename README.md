# DomoSoft Switch version

Domosoft allows to control domotic devices with ESP chips through the HTTP protocol (with web page) and also with the MQTT protocol.

## Start
First of all, download the pre-compiled binary from releases section.
Ok, now through the NODEMCU PY FLASHER write the program on your ESP.
If you have difficulty I suggest you to search on google "ESP8266 FLASH FIRMWARE"
Then configure your device by connecting it to the internet (connect to device wifi via your smartphone and insert the credentials).
## Develop

If you are a developer and you want to compile DomoSoft download the repository and open it with Arduino program.
